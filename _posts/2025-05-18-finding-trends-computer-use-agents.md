I wanted to see what agent frameworks are gaining popularity so I decided to give quite a vauge prompt to all tools to see exactly what they would do and what they would find.

Prompt: "Go to GitHub Insights, Pypistats and Google Search Trends to report on the trends for these 5 frameworks LangGraph, Pydantic AI ..."

- https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai
- https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra
- https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI

I have created a visual to show the trajectory they all decided to take.
