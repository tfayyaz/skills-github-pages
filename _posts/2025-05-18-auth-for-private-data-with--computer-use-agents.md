In my previous post I use these tools to access public data

However where these tools could be even more powerful is when they can access public data.

"2. Dashboards -> Synthesis: Dynamic AI-driven interfaces
For years, dashboards have served as the primary interface for interacting with complex systems such as observability stacks, analytics, cloud consoles (think AWS), and more. But their design often suffers from an overloaded UX: too many knobs, charts, and tabs that force users to both hunt for information and figure out how to act on it. Especially for non-power users or across teams, these dashboards can become intimidating or inefficient. Users know what they want to achieve, but not where to look or which filters to apply to get there.

The latest generation of AI models offers a potential shift. Instead of treating dashboards as rigid canvases, we can layer in search and interaction. LLMs can now help users find the right control (“Where can I adjust the rate limiter settings for this API?”); synthesize screen-wide data into digestible insights (“Summarize the error trends across all services in staging over the past 24 hours”); and surface unknown/unknowns (“Given what you know about my business, generate a list of metrics I should pay attention to this quarter”)."

There are a few players in the auth space.
